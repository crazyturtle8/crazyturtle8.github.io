Despite being split up in three main islands the ruling has been run between 3 families for the past 500 years without a problem. Some say they have achieved national peace, Others… not so much and say those royal families are just blinded by the power and try to oppress anyone who claims they are wrong. Those three families you ask? well lets say normally you would not think they could work together as their interests and specialties differ quite a bit.\nInhabitants\nTake the Wilwyn Family. A tribe of Elves and Wood-elves who decided to join hands after their first War with the dragonborns in the hopes of fending of any other threads to their forest. Living high in the most West forest, the Silverveil Forest. A giant forest where you can only find your way if you are deemed worthy of the Royal family otherwise the forest would forbid you from ever leaving. Dying and becoming food for the forest to grow bigger. Tales say that in the last 20 years alone over 30 persons went missing last seen near the forest.\n\nNext up we have our Dragonborn family, Lun, Who decided that one of the island would be theirs. Specializing in hand to hand combat and a fighting style that resembles a Warlock, most people tend to be a little tense every time they meet one as they know that this means business. Their island, fitting called Dragon’s roost, resembled the head of a dragon. although no real dragons have been spotted in the last 100 years people still believe that those dragons are the reasons why you can hear an ear-deafening roar when passing close to the island\n\nthe last Family of the three are us, the humans. while there have been a couple of minor changes of our royal family, for the last 15 years it has been our beloved Queen, Emmalynn Chern, who has been sitting on the throne. Specializing in Magic and arcana our queen has started multiple schools dedicated to researching the use of mana and other means of using magic.\nNature"},"DnD/CAMPAIN/World/Country/Cities--and--Towns/Grimwel-Town":{"slug":"DnD/CAMPAIN/World/Country/Cities--and--Towns/Grimwel-Town","filePath":"DnD/CAMPAIN/World/Country/Cities & Towns/Grimwel Town.md","title":"Grimwel Town","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"General Info\nGrimwel is a small, coastal Town near the southern edge of the kingdom of Khalhia.
